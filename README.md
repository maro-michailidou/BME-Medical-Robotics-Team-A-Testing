# BME-Medical-Robotics-Team-A-Testing

This repository is my individual contribution in code, for the [Medical Robotics Team A project](https://github.com/maro-michailidou/BME-Medical-Robotics-Team-A) needed for the Biomedical Engineering MSc by the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. 

All documentation for this vode is available at the [Wiki](https://github.com/maro-michailidou/BME-Medical-Robotics-Team-A-Testing/wiki) tab of this repository. To run all of the test files, the code can be downloaded and the two files (Charalampos, project2) should be opened as different projects in Matlab and executed. Matlab Online was used for the development of the testing code, and it has been confirmed that the files run in the Matlab environment 24.a. 

All the test cases cover 24 different test cases, with 19 being successful tests and only 5 showing errors. The faulty tests are mostly in the TestInverseKinematics file which I include in this repository for future debugging but not in the documentation or my personal report. 
### The correspondent test files are my own work: 

1) TestRST_4DOF_finger_model

2) TestForwardKinematics

3) tests_MQTT_finger_sender

4) custom_objective_funcTest_renamed

5) GUI_get_all_positionsTest

6) TestAnalyticalandNumericalSolver
